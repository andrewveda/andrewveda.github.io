      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Assistant Professor of English who treats learning as the highest form of 
        self-creation. As a chess player, I bring the game's clarity, discipline, and logic into the communication classroom — guiding students to express themselves boldly, thoughtfully, and purposefully.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core mission is to gamify the learning journey so students fall in love with learning through curiosity, challenge, and intrinsic motivation. Every class, every activity, and every project is designed to help my students grow into the best version of themselves.

      <h2>🧭 Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe students learn best when they feel safe to experiment, reflect, fail, and improve. 
        My classrooms are built around clarity, curiosity, structure, creativity, and student agency.
